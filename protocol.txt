This document will define the protocol that I will use to transfer data between the client and server.

The connection is a TCP connection, thus ensuring proper ordering and receiving.


The data will be packaged in three sections and is designed to allow flexibility in modification from both the client and server end.  The first two sections are required, while the third sections simple concatenates any extra necessary data, and is parsed as defined in Section 2 (see below).


Section 1.  JSON Size Header
    - This section is exactly 4 bytes in length
    - Indicates the size in bytes of Section 2 (needed to parse 2 from 3)
    - Little-endian unsigned long (i.e. '>L')


Section 2.  JSON Data
    - Data serialized with JSON
    - Can contain any data, up to the server to interpret
    - Reserved keyword "data_blocks":
        - Value is a list of all additional data blocks
        - Each list entry contains at least the following keywords:
            - "name": Used to reference data from other entries in Section 2
            - "size": Size in bytes of the data in Section 3
        - Data in Section 3 is to be concatenated contiguously
        - The order of the "data_blocks" list must match the order of the concatenated data

Section 3.  Extra Data Blocks
    - Limited to 4GB data blocks (max capacity of size indicator in "data_blocks")
    - Any extra data that is not parsed is ignored (perhaps replay with warning?)
